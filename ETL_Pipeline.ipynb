This ratio may be influenced by systematic measurement effects from non-biological sources that can introduce biases in the estimated ratios. These biases should be removed before drawing conclusions about the relative levels of DNA. The performance of existing gene expression microarray normalization strategies has not been evaluated for removing systematic biases encountered in array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), which aims to detect single copy gains and losses typically in samples with heterogeneous cell populations resulting in only slight shifts in signal ratios. The purpose of this work is to establish a framework for correcting the systematic sources of variation in high density CGH array images, while maintaining the true biological variations.After an investigation of the systematic variations in the data from two array CGH platforms, SMRT (Sub Mega base Resolution Tiling) BAC arrays and cDNA arrays of Pollack et al., we have developed a stepwise normalization framework integrating novel and existing normalization methods in order to reduce intensity, spatial, plate and background biases. We used stringent measures to quantify the performance of this stepwise normalization using data derived from 5 sets of experiments representing self-self hybridizations, replicated experiments, detection of single copy changes, array CGH experiments which mimic cell population heterogeneity, and array CGH experiments simulating different levels of gene amplifications and deletions. Our results demonstrate that the three-step normalization procedure provides significant improvement in the sensitivity of detection of single copy changes compared to conventional single step normalization approaches in both SMRT BAC array and cDNA array platforms.The proposed stepwise normalization framework preserves the minute copy number changes while removing the observed systematic biases.",[["53f43184dabfaedf4354af59",null,"mkhojast@bccrc.ca","5b86c4a8e1cd8e14a3b0a117","Mehrnoush Khojasteh",null,null,null,null,"British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",null,"5f71b28e1c455f439fe3cad2",null,null,null],["548a7e4ddabfaed7b5fa41f6",null,"wanlam@bccrc.ca","5b8690dee1cd8e14a34ed9ef","Wan L Lam",null,null,null,null,"British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada",null,null,null,null,null],["54480291dabfae87b7dc1fa9",null,"rababw@ece.ubc.ca","5b86c1e5e1cd8e14a39d1258","Rabab K Ward",null,null,null,null,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",null,"5f71b28e1c455f439fe3cad2",null,null,null],["54311531dabfae8f2912ab95",null,"cmacaula@bccrc.ca","5b8690dee1cd8e14a34ed9ef","Calum MacAulay",null,null,null,"0000-0003-4440-2792","British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada",null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1186/1471-2105-6-274",["CDNA Arrays","Normalization (statistics)","Pattern recognition","Biology","Population Heterogeneity","High density","Comparative genomic hybridization","Artificial intelligence","Mega-","Genetics","DNA microarray","Gene expression microarray"],"","1471-2105","1",["microarrays","copy number","genetic variation","gene expression","nucleic acid hybridization","gene amplification","algorithms","bioinformatics","calibration"],"en","110","274","274","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99792b7602d9701f5b2c7_0.pdf",["53e9baebb7602d970471a152"],"A stepwise framework for the normalization of array CGH data.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-6-274","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297240?report=xml&format=text","https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1471-2105-6-274","http://www.webofknowledge.com/"],["54826079582fc50b5e20fe5b",null,null,null,null,null,null,"BMC Bioinformatics",null,null,null,null,"0"],"6","2005",110,"Journal","[Mehrnoush Khojasteh, Wan L Lam, Rabab K Ward, Calum MacAulay]","A stepwise framework for the normalization of array CGH data.","BMC Bioinform.","[female, andy, female, andy]"],["53e99796b7602d9701f5cf4e","Even fifteen years ago, most of us felt privileged to be co-located with a terminal room enabling us to run our various programs on remote mainframes.

A gesture controller is an optimal-policy controller that schedules gesture animations in real time based on acoustic features in the user's speech. The controller consists of an inference layer, which infers a distribution over a set of hidden states from the speech signal, and a control layer, which selects the optimal motion based on the inferred state distribution. The inference layer, consisting of a specialized conditional random field, learns the hidden structure in body language style and associates it with acoustic features in speech. The control layer uses reinforcement learning to construct an optimal policy for selecting motion clips from a distribution over the learned hidden states. The modularity of the proposed method allows customization of a character's gesture repertoire, animation of non-human characters, and the use of additional inputs such as speech recognition or direct user control.",[["53f42828dabfaeb22f3ce756",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3","Sergey Levine",null,"544bd96545ce266baeca9366",null,null,"Stanford University",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b",null,null,null],["53f4589ddabfaedd74e36b9a",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3","Philipp Krähenbühl",null,"544bd96545ce266baeca9366",null,null,"Stanford University",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b",null,null,null],["53f48525dabfaedf436905bf",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3","Sebastian Thrun",null,"544bd96545ce266baeca9366",null,null,"Stanford University",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b",null,null,null],["54089dfbdabfae450f42ee3c",null,null,"5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3","Vladlen Koltun",null,"544bd96545ce266baeca9366",null,null,"Stanford University",null,"5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b",null,null,null]],"10.1145/1833349.1778861",null,"","0730-0301","4",["data-driven animation","speech signal","optimal control","gesture controller","direct user control","human animation","hidden state","schedules gesture animation","control layer","speech recognition","gesture repertoire","gesture synthesis","acoustic feature","inference layer","nonverbal behavior generation"],"en","125","11","1","",null,"Gesture controllers",["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1833351.1778861","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1778765.1778861"],["555036f67cea80f95416a9f4",null,null,null,null,null,null,"ACM Trans.

This ratio may be influenced by systematic measurement effects from non-biological sources that can introduce biases in the estimated ratios. These biases should be removed before drawing conclusions about the relative levels of DNA. The performance of existing gene expression microarray normalization strategies has not been evaluated for removing systematic biases encountered in array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), which aims to detect single copy gains and losses typically in samples with heterogeneous cell populations resulting in only slight shifts in signal ratios. The purpose of this work is to establish a framework for correcting the systematic sources of variation in high density CGH array images, while maintaining the true biological variations.After an investigation of the systematic variations in the data from two array CGH platforms, SMRT (Sub Mega base Resolution Tiling) BAC arrays and cDNA arrays of Pollack et al., we have developed a stepwise normalization framework integrating novel and existing normalization methods in order to reduce intensity, spatial, plate and background biases. We used stringent measures to quantify the performance of this stepwise normalization using data derived from 5 sets of experiments representing self-self hybridizations, replicated experiments, detection of single copy changes, array CGH experiments which mimic cell population heterogeneity, and array CGH experiments simulating different levels of gene amplifications and deletions. Our results demonstrate that the three-step normalization procedure provides significant improvement in the sensitivity of detection of single copy changes compared to conventional single step normalization approaches in both SMRT BAC array and cDNA array platforms.The proposed stepwise normalization framework preserves the minute copy number changes while removing the observed systematic biases.</td><td>List(List(53f43184dabfaedf4354af59, null, mkhojast@bccrc.ca, 5b86c4a8e1cd8e14a3b0a117, Mehrnoush Khojasteh, null, null, null, null, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, null, 5f71b28e1c455f439fe3cad2, null, null, null), List(548a7e4ddabfaed7b5fa41f6, null, wanlam@bccrc.ca, 5b8690dee1cd8e14a34ed9ef, Wan L Lam, null, null, null, null, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada, null, null, null, null, null), List(54480291dabfae87b7dc1fa9, null, rababw@ece.ubc.ca, 5b86c1e5e1cd8e14a39d1258, Rabab K Ward, null, null, null, null, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, null, 5f71b28e1c455f439fe3cad2, null, null, null), List(54311531dabfae8f2912ab95, null, cmacaula@bccrc.ca, 5b8690dee1cd8e14a34ed9ef, Calum MacAulay, null, null, null, 0000-0003-4440-2792, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1186/1471-2105-6-274</td><td>List(CDNA Arrays, Normalization (statistics), Pattern recognition, Biology, Population Heterogeneity, High density, Comparative genomic hybridization, Artificial intelligence, Mega-, Genetics, DNA microarray, Gene expression microarray)</td><td></td><td>1471-2105</td><td>1</td><td>List(microarrays, copy number, genetic variation, gene expression, nucleic acid hybridization, gene amplification, algorithms, bioinformatics, calibration)</td><td>en</td><td>110</td><td>274</td><td>274</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99792b7602d9701f5b2c7_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9baebb7602d970471a152)</td><td>A stepwise framework for the normalization of array CGH data.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-6-274, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297240?report=xml&format=text, https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1471-2105-6-274, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(54826079582fc50b5e20fe5b, null, null, null, null, null, null, BMC Bioinformatics, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>6</td><td>2005</td><td>110</td><td>Journal</td><td>[Mehrnoush Khojasteh, Wan L Lam, Rabab K Ward, Calum MacAulay]</td><td>A stepwise framework for the normalization of array CGH data.</td><td>BMC Bioinform.</td><td>[female, andy, female, andy]</td></tr><tr><td>53e99796b7602d9701f5cf4e</td><td>Even fifteen years ago, most of us felt privileged to be co-located with a terminal room enabling us to run our various programs on remote mainframes.

A gesture controller is an optimal-policy controller that schedules gesture animations in real time based on acoustic features in the user's speech. The controller consists of an inference layer, which infers a distribution over a set of hidden states from the speech signal, and a control layer, which selects the optimal motion based on the inferred state distribution. The inference layer, consisting of a specialized conditional random field, learns the hidden structure in body language style and associates it with acoustic features in speech. The control layer uses reinforcement learning to construct an optimal policy for selecting motion clips from a distribution over the learned hidden states. The modularity of the proposed method allows customization of a character's gesture repertoire, animation of non-human characters, and the use of additional inputs such as speech recognition or direct user control.</td><td>List(List(53f42828dabfaeb22f3ce756, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3, Sergey Levine, null, 544bd96545ce266baeca9366, null, null, Stanford University, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b, null, null, null), List(53f4589ddabfaedd74e36b9a, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3, Philipp Krähenbühl, null, 544bd96545ce266baeca9366, null, null, Stanford University, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b, null, null, null), List(53f48525dabfaedf436905bf, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3, Sebastian Thrun, null, 544bd96545ce266baeca9366, null, null, Stanford University, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b, null, null, null), List(54089dfbdabfae450f42ee3c, null, null, 5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3, Vladlen Koltun, null, 544bd96545ce266baeca9366, null, null, Stanford University, null, 5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1145/1833349.1778861</td><td>null</td><td></td><td>0730-0301</td><td>4</td><td>List(data-driven animation, speech signal, optimal control, gesture controller, direct user control, human animation, hidden state, schedules gesture animation, control layer, speech recognition, gesture repertoire, gesture synthesis, acoustic feature, inference layer, nonverbal behavior generation)</td><td>en</td><td>125</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>null</td><td>Gesture controllers</td><td>List(http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1833351.1778861, https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1778765.1778861)</td><td>List(555036f67cea80f95416a9f4, null, null, null, null, null, null, ACM Trans.

To store a high capacity secret data these carrier files are not very supportive.

This kind of parallel mechanism decomposes application according to the actual computation power of each node in dynamic Grid environment.</td><td>List(List(542a6734dabfae646d55cc87, null, gaoyibo@gmail.com, 5b86cb35e1cd8e14a3e00691, Kun Gao, null, null, null, null, Computer Science and Information Technology College, Zhejiang Wanli University, China, null, 5f71b6101c455f439fe555a5, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/978-3-540-85565-1_38</td><td>List(Data mining, Data stream mining, Grid computing, Data-intensive computing, Computer science, Directed acyclic graph, Semantic grid, Knowledge extraction, Business process discovery, Grid, Distributed computing)</td><td></td><td>0302-9743</td><td></td><td>List(knowledge discovery grid, dynamic grid environment, high performance data mining, parallel optimization method, grid feature, high performance ddm application, data mining grid, decomposing data mining application, data mining parallelization, data intensive computing problem, computational grid environment, data mining application, knowledge discovery, distributed computing, data mining, data intensive computing, parallelization, grid computing, directed acyclic graph)</td><td>en</td><td>4</td><td>312</td><td>306</td><td></td><td>List(53e99cbbb7602d970256c4af, 53e9b092b7602d9703afec3f, 53e9b089b7602d9703af06a7, 53e9ae9cb7602d97038c0529, 53e9b5f3b7602d9704144753, 558aac78e4b0b32fcb3831b7, 53e9bc3bb7602d97048b1ed7, 53e9b7b4b7602d970435c58f, 53e9b672b7602d97041db0b8, 53e9b96eb7602d970455d792, 53e9ae97b7602d97038ba7dd, 53e9adf7b7602d97038042d9, 53e9bd6ab7602d9704a0644e)</td><td>A Uniform Parallel Optimization Method for Knowledge Discovery Grid</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-85565-1_38, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53a727f720f7420be8ba3092, null, null, null, null, null, null, KES (2), null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>5178</td><td>2008</td><td>4</td><td>Journal</td><td>[Kun Gao]</td><td>A Uniform Parallel Optimization Method for Knowledge Discovery Grid.</td><td>KES</td><td>[andy]</td></tr><tr><td>53e99796b7602d9701f5c851</td><td>We introduce Green Coordinates for closed polyhedral cages. The coordinates are motivated by Green's third integral identity and respect both the vertices position and faces orientation of the cage. We show that Green Coordinates lead to space deformations with a shape-preserving property. In particular, in 2D they induce conformal mappings, and extend naturally to quasi-conformal mappings in 3D. In both cases we derive closed-form expressions for the coordinates, yielding a simple and fast algorithm for cage-based space deformation. We compare the performance of Green Coordinates with those of Mean Value Coordinates and Harmonic Coordinates and show that the advantage of the shape-preserving property is not achieved at the expense of speed or simplicity. We also show that the new coordinates extend the mapping in a natural analytic manner to the exterior of the cage, allowing the employment of partial cages.</td><td>List(List(53f43012dabfaeb2ac00ba9f, null, null, 5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb7ba, Yaron Lipman, null, 544bd96d45ce266baed0be8b, null, null, Tel-Aviv University, null, 5f71b28d1c455f439fe3ca38, null, null, null), List(53f44d63dabfaee4dc7ed675, null, null, 5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb7ba, David Levin, null, 544bd96d45ce266baed0be8b, null, null, Tel-Aviv University, null, 5f71b28d1c455f439fe3ca38, null, null, null), List(54488419dabfae87b7e38d20, null, null, 5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cb7ba, Daniel Cohen-Or, null, 544bd96d45ce266baed0be8b, null, null, Tel-Aviv University, null, 5f71b28d1c455f439fe3ca38, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1145/1399504.1360677</td><td>null</td><td></td><td>0730-0301</td><td>3</td><td>List(Green Coordinates, space deformation, Harmonic Coordinates, cage-based space deformation, closed-form expression, closed polyhedral cage, shape-preserving property, Mean Value Coordinates, conformal mapping, partial cage)</td><td>en</td><td>370</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>null</td><td>Green Coordinates</td><td>List(http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1360612.1360677, https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1360612.1360677)</td><td>List(555036f67cea80f95416a9f4, null, null, null, null, null, null, ACM Trans.
